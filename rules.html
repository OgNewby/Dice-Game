        The rules of this game are pretty simple. To win, be the first player to
        reach 100 points. Sounds simple right? Well, not so fast there scooter,
        if you roll a 1, your turn is over and you lose your current points. So,
        when you think your luck is running out, click that hold button to save
        your points and end your turn.
